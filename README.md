Case Study Summary: Health Sector Data Analysis

Introduction
I came across an informative health sector dataset on Kaggle, which piqued my interest as I had never worked with healthcare data before. The dataset included columns such as Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, Date of Admission, Doctor, Hospital, Insurance Provider, Billing Amount, Room Number, Admission Type, Discharge Date, Medication, and Test Results.

Initial Data Preparation
1. Exploring the Data: 
   - First, I opened the dataset in Excel to examine the columns and ensure they were properly formatted, either separated by underscores or spaces.
   - After verifying the format, I prepared to import the data into MySQL.

2. Database and Table Creation:
   - Created a database named `healthproject`.
   - Created a table called `health` with appropriate columns and data types, ensuring they were set to `NOT NULL` where necessary.

Data Transformation
1. Creating Age Groups:
   - Added a new column `age_group` to categorize ages into "young", "middle-aged", and "old" using the `CASE` and `END` statements.
   - Updated the table with these new age group values.

2. Adding Date Columns:
   - Added columns `day_name` and `month_name` to record the day of the week and the month of admission.

Analytical Techniques
1.Basic Demographics and Medical Conditions:
   - Identified the distinct medical conditions in the dataset.
   - Counted the number of medical conditions by gender.
   - Analyzed medical conditions by age group and gender.
   - Counted distinct age groups by medical condition.
   - Found distinct blood types and their distribution among medical conditions.

2. Hospital, Insurance, and Financial Analysis:
   - Listed the distinct hospitals represented in the dataset.
   - Analyzed medical conditions by insurance provider.
   - Calculated the total profit by insurance provider.
   - Found the total profit by medical condition and insurance provider.

3. Medication Analysis:
   - Identified the most frequently used medications for each medical condition.

4. Monthly and Daily Patient Analysis:
   - Analyzed the number of patients admitted each month.
   - Analyzed the number of patients admitted each day in August.

Advanced Analytical Techniques
- Utilized `CASE` and `END` statements to create new categorical columns such as `age_group`.
- Employed aggregate functions to group and count data, providing insights into patient demographics and financial metrics.

This case study provided valuable insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, and financial aspects of healthcare, enhancing my understanding and experience in health sector data analysis.
